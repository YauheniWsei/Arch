    Acknowledgements
 A big thank you to my instructor for the "Computer Systems Architecture" course,
 who inspired me to undertake this project. Without their guidance, I wouldn't
 have truly understood how the processor works at a fundamental level, comprehended
 electronic circuits, or passed the exam. Throughout the development, I've learned
 a lot more than what's mandated by the curriculum. Dziękuję!


*this project was specifically prepared for the "Computer Systems Architecture" course in the first semester.
